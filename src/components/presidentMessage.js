      <p>
        Dear Friends and Colleagues, On behalf of the Korean American
        Otolaryngology Society (KAOS) and our board members, I am delighted to
        extend a warm welcome and invitation to the upcoming AAO-HNSF 2024
        meeting in Miami, Florida! <br />
        <br />
        For 15 years, The Korean American Satellite Symposium (KASS) has
        exemplified international collaboration by bringing together the Korean
        Society of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (KORL-HNS) and
        KAOS. This year, we are excited to feature two international symposia at
        the AAO-HNSF meeting on Sunday, September 29, 2024. These sessions will
        highlight the exceptional collaborative efforts of our communities and
        cover key topics in otology and rhinology.
        <br />
        <br />
        The otology symposium, titled “Current Advances in Cochlear
        Implantation,” will be moderated by Dr. Jun-Ho Lee (Seoul National
        University) with speakers Dr. Jae-Jin Song (Seoul National University),
        Dr. Jong Dae Lee (Soonchunhyang University), and Dr. Ana Kim (Columbia
        University, New York).
        <br />
        <br />
        The rhinology symposium, entitled “Decoding Immunophenotypes in Chronic
        Rhinosinusitis: Tailoring Treatment Approaches Across Ethnicities,” will
        be moderated by Dr. Chae-Seo Rhee (Seoul National University), with
        speakers Dr. Tae-Bin Won (Seoul National University), Dr. Jin-Young Min
        (Kyung Hee University), and myself (UCLA).
        <br />
        <br />
        On Sunday night, we will host the KASS meeting at the beautiful
        Marseilles Beachfront Hotel, just a short walk from the Miami Beach
        Convention Center. We are pleased to feature two distinguished guest
        speakers: Dr. Benjamin Bleier (Harvard University) will present “Seeing
        Further: State of the Art Endoscopic Orbital Surgery,” and Dr. Tendy
        Chiang (Ohio State University) will give a talk titled
        “Tissue-engineered Trachea: How Creating Grafts for Tomorrow Can Help Us
        Become Better Surgeons Today.”
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, I would like to thank the board members of KAOS, especially
        past presidents Drs. Joseph Han, Albert Park, Kenneth Lee, and David Chi
        for their wisdom and guidance through the years. I would also like to
        express my deep gratitude to Professor Jun-Ho Lee, MD, PhD, Chairman of
        KORL-HNS, and Professor Jae-Jin Song, MD, PhD, General Secretary of
        KORL-HNS, for their support and collaborative efforts. And finally,
        special thanks to Dr. Do-Yeon Cho for his tireless work to organize the
        symposia and program.
        <br />
        <br />I look forward to connecting with everyone soon in Miami!
